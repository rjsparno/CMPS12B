I take in shakespeare.txt as an input file, then insert each unique word
into a hashtable which records its frequency. Then I make an array that
stores each key, and then sorts each key by their frequencies. After
that it takes in the command line test-input file and takes in pairs
of integers which correspond to words, and their frequency ranks
and traverses the array until it finds the specified word
