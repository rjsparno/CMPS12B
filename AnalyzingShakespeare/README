Create an executable jar file using make on the Unix Command Line
Use commandline arguments java -jar Bard.jar more-input.txt out.txt
will print results to out.txt

test-input.txt follows the format of 3 0 on each where 3 is the word length and 0 is the rank of the word
by its frequency

I take in shakespeare.txt as an input file, then insert each unique word
into a hashtable which records its frequency. Then I make an array that
stores each key, and then sorts each key by their frequencies. After
that it takes in the command line test-input file and takes in pairs
of integers which correspond to words, and their frequency ranks
and traverses the array until it finds the specified word.
prints out to Output file
