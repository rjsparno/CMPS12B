Solution:
Create the board as a single dimensional array
set the array size equal to the user input
iterate over the array starting at 0
using a checker to check if the solution
up to the given index is correct, and then move on
then once you get to the end, check if it matches
with the specific solution in the input text
and if it does, then print and move to the next line
of input
